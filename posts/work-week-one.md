Last week, I caught myself wondering what other web developers work on day-to-day. My feeds are full of amazing projects and designs, leading to a major case of impostor syndrome. So why don't we talk about the mundane projects more often?

**Here's my first attempt at documenting the mundane:**

- Campaign Monitor newsletter template;
- edits to two WordPress sites currently in development;
- bug fixes on a site that launched three weeks ago;
- private WordPress plugin;
- custom WordPress theme and private plugin;
- finish testing and deliver an updated WordPress theme;
- discovery on a new project starting soon (mainly trying to nail down architecture)

I think that covers everything for this week. If you'd like to share your own list, let me know on Twitter ([@analogophile](https://twitter.com/analogophile)). I'd love to see what you're working on!
